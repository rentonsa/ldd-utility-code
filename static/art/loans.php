            As a collection with no dedicated gallery or exhibition space, making artworks available for display both within and outside the University is a key priority for the Art Collection. It is a process which enables both the sharing of resources and important cultural heritage with partner organisations, as well as the discovery of new research and insights into works owned.<br><br>
            We operate two forms of loans – external and internal – and each is expanded upon in the below sections.

                    <p class="desc-text">The Art Collection is regularly made available for exhibition to external venues, as part of large and small scale exhibitions, touring shows and festivals. As an accredited collection we seek to collaborate with venues that can provide the conditions needed for our works, and over the last 5 years we have made over 220 works available for loan, reaching over 1 million people. <br><br> For more information on our loans process please contact <a href="#contact">us here</a>.

                        A significant portion of the Art Collection can be viewed across the University campus, and movement and selection of artworks for public spaces is managed via the Art Collections Curatorial Team within the Centre for Research Collections.<br><br>
                        For University staff interested in changing their environment or organising an exhibition, advice and support can be provided on the suitability of works for spaces identified, as well as practical and ethical considerations of selecting artworks.<br><br>

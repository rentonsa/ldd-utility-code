            <div class="content">
                The idea for the Coimbra Group Collections Platform developed out of the virtual exhibition platform, which was created for the Coimbra Group conference
                hosted by the University of Edinburgh in June 2017.
                This unique collaboration brought together items from across the Coimbra Group institutions.

                The Platform is designed to fulfil three main functions:

                <li>         To Increase awareness of the rich and diverse material held by the Coimbra Group universities across Europe</li>
                <li>    To provide an easy route to find out more about the individual collections held by the Coimbra Group institutions</li>
                <li>         To support greater collaboration between Coimbra Group Institutions in particular relating to development of new projects and grant proposals.</li>
